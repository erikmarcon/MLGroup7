Group 7 - Machine Learning
Using data from the Netflix Prize Challenge that took place some years algo (available on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data), we're going to create a movie recommendation system. 
The data consists of user ids, movies they watched and how much they liked it (from 1-5). Based on this, we will recommend movies that users have not yet watched.
